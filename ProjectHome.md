[ImageShack](http://www.imageshack.us) is a great free service that will host images for you. [Windows Live Writer](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/) is a great free tool for authoring blog posts. Say you're writing a blog entry and you want to put an image in your blog that will be hosted by ImageShack. What do you do?

If you're using the ImageShack Upload Plugin for Windows Live Writer, it's as simple as selecting the image from your disk. The upload plugin will automatically post the image to ImageShack and insert it into your blog post.
